# ReactCheckout
React Kata Implement the code for a checkout system that handles pricing schemes such as “apples cost 50 pence, three apples cost £1.30.” Implement the code for a basket that calculates the total price of a number of items. In a normal store, things are identified using Stock Keeping Units, or SKUs. In our store, we’ll use individual letters of the alphabet (A, B, C, and so on). Our goods are priced individually. In addition, some items are multi-priced: buy ‘n’ of them, and they’ll cost you ‘y’ pence. For example, item ‘A’ might cost 50 pence individually, but this week we have a special offer: buy three ‘A’s and they’ll cost you £1.30.
